# SplitChain Business Model

## Problem Statement

### The Multi-Chain Fragmentation Problem

Crypto users today hold assets across multiple chains:
- Arbitrum for cheap DeFi
- Polygon for gaming/NFTs
- Ethereum for security
- Base for new applications
- Optimism for specific protocols

When these users need to split expenses (travel, shared living, events), they face:

1. **Bridging Friction**: Manual bridging costs $1-20 and takes 1-30 minutes (depending on the chain)
2. **Gas Costs**: Every expense logged on-chain costs $0.01-2
3. **Coordination Overhead**: "What chain are you on?" conversations
4. **Poor UX**: Not comparable to Venmo/Splitwise simplicity

### Market Size

- **Expense Splitting Market**: $612M 
- **Cross-Chain Bridges Volume**: $100B+ annually
- **Crypto Users**: 560M+ globally (https://www.demandsage.com/crypto-adoption-statistics/#:~:text=The%20count%20of%20cryptocurrency%20users,425%20million%20to%20560%20million.) 
- **Target Users**: Crypto-native groups who hold assets on multiple chains
